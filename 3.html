  <h2>Berlin</h2>
  <p>Berlin (/bɜːrˈlɪn/; German pronunciation: [bɛɐ̯ˈliːn]) is the capital and the largest city of Germany, as well as one of its 16 constituent states.
    With a steadily growing population of approximately 3.7 million,[4] Berlin is the second most populous city proper in the European Union behind London and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union.
    [5] Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of the rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has roughly 6 million residents.
    [6][7][8][9] Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate.
    Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes.[10]</p>
